# **nowayCAS** - Symbolic Mathematics for Luau / Roblox Studio 🔥
This is **nowayCAS**, a Computer Algebra System built specifically for Roblox Studio. It brings symbolic expressions, algebraic manipulation, and pretty-printing into an environment that normally has none of these capabilities.

Whether you're building developer tools, educational experiences, or just experimenting with symbolic math inside Roblox, nowayCAS gives you a clean, modular foundation to work with.

## **Why nowayCAS?**
Roblox Studio does not have built-in symbolic math, meaning it wouldn't be able to parse expressions like "3x + 4" and "2x+4y^2+6z" into its own built-in math library or anything like that. **nowayCAS changes that.**

It is a pure-Luau library that:
- Parses mathematical expressions into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** optimized with **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**
- Supports variables, constants, operators, and functions in one expression
- Allows symboilic manipulation through a modular internal API
- Provides a clean external API for constructing and transforming expressions
- Outputs expressions in pretty-print, DAG print, and LaTeX print
- Operator overloading for symbolic arithmetic between two expressions.

## **Development Status**
The **nowayCAS** library started development on 1st January 2026 and it's still currently on beta. This means it's unpolished, have missing features, or buggy.

## **Roadmap**
- Fix the factor system.

## ❤️ Contributing
**nowayCAS** is still young and it is open for collaborations, ideas, and feedback. Feel free issues, suggest features, or help shape the roadmap. Please see
