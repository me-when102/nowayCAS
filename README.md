# **nowayCAS** - Symbolic Mathematics for Luau / Roblox Studio 🔥🔥🔥
This is **nowayCAS**, a Computer Algebra System _(and not Context Action Service)_ built specifically for Roblox Studio. It brings symbolic expressions, algebraic manipulation, and pretty-printing into an environment that normally has none.

## **Why nowayCAS?**
**nowayCAS** is a pure-Luau library that enables real symbolic computation direclty in Roblox experiences and tools. Using the concept of the **Abstract Syntax Tree** with **Directed Acyclic Graph**, **nowayCAS** operates in nodes of *variable*, *constant* and *operator* kinds which can be manipulated in the library's modular system.

In the external API (in `nowayCAS.luau`), you are able to create an **expression instance** where you are able to manipulate it using its external API features.

## **Development Status**
The **nowayCAS** library started development on 1st January 2026 and it's still currently on beta. This means it's unpolished, have missing features, or buggy.
